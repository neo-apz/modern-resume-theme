    Modern online services are shifting away from monolithic applications to
    hundreds of loosely-coupled microservices because of the benefits they bring
    in the form of scalability, reliability, programmability and deployment.
    Because of the reduction in service time, the improvements in speed in
    emerging network fabrics and communication protocols,
    the data transformation software converting object formats from one microservice
    to another is becoming a bottleneck.
    In this paper, we introduce Optimus Prime (OP), a programmable accelerator
    for data transformation that uses a novel hardware abstraction,
    an in-memory schema specifying the operations required for data transformation.
    The schema enables the accelerator front-end to maximize memory-level parallelism
    through multiple pointer chains and gather data conversion tuples for
    a parallel back-end. We show that OP can achieve a transformation throughput
    at the network card line rate and has 100x higher throughput compared to software
    at a tiny fraction of the CPU's silicon overhead or power.
    We evaluate microservices on Thrift and show up to 30% reduction
    in overall service latency.

    The popularity of online services drives the need for bigger datacenters with more server processors.
    As Moore’s law continues, the number of transistors on chip rises exponentially,
    enabling us to have CMPs with hundreds of cores.
    However, due to the slowdown in Dennard’s scaling, we cannot power up all of them at the same time.
    Hence, soon we will enter an era of “dark silicon”, in which we cannot power up fast and dense processors.
    In this work, we explore the potential directions to improve the energy efficiency of
    server processors in the post-Dennard era. Moreover, we investigate the hardware- and software-related
    constraints of designing a server processor for modern cloud services,
    and we propose an approach based on near-threshold computing (NTC) to
    design energy efficient server processors.
    We propose an architecture based on the FD-SOI process technology for NTC in servers.
    Our study demonstrates the benefits of NTC and proposes several directions to
    synergistically increase the energy proportionality of a near-threshold server.
